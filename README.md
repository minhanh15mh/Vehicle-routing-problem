Kinh Do is a small bakery that supplies 5 major customers with bread each morning. If we locate the bakery at P0(0,0), then the five customer locations and their daily requirements are:
Customer: 1,2,3,4,5
Location: (15, 30), (5, 30), (10, 20), (5, 5), (20, 10)
Daily requirements: 85, 162, 26, 140, 110

The bakery has several delivery trucks, each having a capacity of 300 loaves. We shall assume that the cost of traveling between any two locations is Euclidean distances.

a.	Calculate the cost matrix

b.	Find a delivery pattern that both meets customer demand and minimizes delivery costs, subject to not exceeding the capacity constraint on the size of the delivery trucks.
